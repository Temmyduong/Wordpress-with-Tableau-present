##Audience

The target audience for these visualisations is FiTheo, the supervisor of a rapidly expanding automobile dealership. Observing the increasing demand for electric vehicles, he decided to invest more in electric car models to expand his market share. However, to ensure this investment is economically sound and does not heighten business risks, FiTheo needs a well-defined marketing strategy based on actual data.

To this end, FiTheo has gathered data on electric vehicle products from Beautiful Data, a leading supplier in the electric vehicle sector, for the first two quarters of 2024. He plans to use this information to assess the business performance of the current electric car models and, furthermore, to understand the characteristics and needs of potential customers. Consequently, he aims to develop a suitable marketing strategy that will support his investment decisions.

##Questions to be Answered
Are the current electric car models popular? What is the usage rate of each type (BEV, FCEV, PHEV)?
What advantages do electric car models offer that attract buyers? Which electric car truly saves fuel and maintenance costs compared to traditional cars?
Which electric car model has the best battery technology and range?
What are the characteristics and motivations of potential customers? Who are they, and what are their needs?

##To answer these questions, FiTheo needs information about:
An overview of the number of electric cars and the average age of target customers across product categories and states.
The benefits of electric cars.
Performance capability (KM) in rural and urban areas.
Customer Segmentation.
##Initially, FiTheo Needs:
an overview of the number of electric cars and the average age of customers across product categories and states to understand the popularity of each type (BEV, FCEV, PHEV). Additionally, insights into the benefits of electric cars, such as maintenance savings, fuel savings, and insurance cost reductions, will help him identify the advantages over traditional cars. The customer segmentation table will reveal the characteristics and motivations for purchasing, aiding in the creation of a precise marketing strategy. Lastly, he is interested in the performance capability (KM) of electric cars in rural and urban areas to tailor his marketing strategy accordingly.

By utilizing this information, FiTheo will have a comprehensive dataset to make informed investment decisions and develop an effective marketing plan for electric car models, optimizing profitability and ensuring sustainable growth for his dealership.
